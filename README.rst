Dumps the content of the `NARA AAD <https://aad.archives.gov/aad/>`_ electronic
telegram / cables overview table into CSV files.

No need to run the script, see ``output`` directory for CSV files by year.

Works with Py2 and Py3. Python 2.7 requires the 
`backports.csv <https://github.com/ryanhiebert/backports.csv>`_ package.
